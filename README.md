# Force-Directed Graph in React


This project demonstrates the implementation of a force-directed graph using React. A force-directed graph is a type of layout algorithm used to visualize relationships and connections between entities. In this project, we use D3.js, a powerful data visualization library, to create the force-directed graph.
